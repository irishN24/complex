Dear Mr. Green,
I am concerned about your company's computer security. When I inspected your systems, I discovered hacker interference.
This is dangerous because they can steal your data and even change it.
To keep your systems safe, I recommend running an antivirus on all computers and encrypting all data using an encryptor 
This will help, because it will limit attackers' access to data.
Let's meet to discuss this further.
